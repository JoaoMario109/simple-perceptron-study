### Brief study in perceptron

OBS - Does not use this in any professional application or work, its just meant to be a simple study for a presentation and to visualize some behaviors on perceptron, fell free to complement if you like
but this is not meant to be used in any sort of production product.

Also I didn't used any kind of library or cool abstraction to implement the net or even the perceptron itself, only some simple functions for each case that I wanted to test, for production make use of some library that already implements the neural network in a more proper way using correct algebra and transformations and not just a bunch of functions. As mentioned this is just a simple study

### Running

Just make sure to have virtualenv installed in you python and create a virtual environment

`python -m virtualenv .venv`
`source .venv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

And open *perceptron-study.ipynb* in some text editor or IDE that supports a better visualization and interaction and feel free to play around.
